# Brainrot Battle

![Brainrot Battle](static/hero.webp)

A fun, interactive web application where users can vote on absurd "brainrot" characters in head-to-head battles. The characters are ranked using an ELO rating system, similar to chess rankings. Partially vibe-coded, and partially written by myself.

## ðŸŽ® Features

- **Battle System**: Head-to-head voting between random pairs of brainrot characters
- **ELO Rating**: Characters are ranked using a chess-style ELO rating system that adjusts based on wins and losses
- **Leaderboard**: See which brainrot characters are dominating the competition
- **Skip Option**: Don't want to choose between two characters? Skip and get a new battle
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## ðŸ§  What is Brainrot?

Brainrot is absurd Internet slang that may lead to someone losing brain cells. Examples include:
- **Brr brr Patapim**: He is secretly Elon Musk
- **Cappuccino Assassino**: An extremely fast and silent assassin
- **Crocodilo Potatino**: A big ray of sunshine, who does not know he passed away
- **Trippi Troppi**: The king in the water, that can morph into a cat

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

1. **Battles**: Two random brainrot characters are selected and presented to the user
2. **Voting**: Users click on their preferred character
3. **Rating Update**: The ELO ratings of both characters are adjusted based on the outcome
4. **Leaderboard**: Characters are ranked on the leaderboard based on their current ELO rating
